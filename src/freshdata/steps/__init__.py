"""Individual cleaning steps. Each is a pure function:

``step(df, config, report) -> df``

Steps never mutate the caller's original DataFrame: the pipeline hands them a
frame it owns, and steps only ever rebind whole columns or produce new frames
(``.loc`` row selection), never write into shared blocks in place.
